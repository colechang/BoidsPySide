• Add sliders to adjust Boids Behavior ✓
    • amount of particles ~
    • Size ✓
    • Coherence ✓
        Every bird attempts to move towards the average position of other nearby birds.
    • Alignment ✓
        Birds try to change their position so that it corresponds with the average alignment of other nearby birds.
    • Seperation ✓
         Each bird attempts to maintain a reasonable amount of distance 
         between itself and any nearby birds, to prevent overcrowding.
• For now the the boids will be put in a list ✓
• Quadtree Implementation to increase speed and memory ✓
• Spatial Hashing ✓

• Add shading
    would have to make boids 3d and cast shadows off boids

• Add Requirements.txt file for other machines
• Add biases to boids ✓
• Segment code in update_boids function into seperate functions
• Instead of using sqrt function as it is slow, I can use the "alpha max plus beta min" approximation
UPDATE
    Boids have movement and independent logic ✓
    Need to fine tune Constants ✓
    Parallelization
