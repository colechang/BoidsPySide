    • amount of particles
    • Size
    • Coherence
        Every bird attempts to move towards the average position of other nearby birds.
    • Alignment
        Birds try to change their position so that it corresponds with the average alignment of other nearby birds.
    • Seperation
         Each bird attempts to maintain a reasonable amount of distance 
         between itself and any nearby birds, to prevent overcrowding.
• For now the the boids will be put in a list
• Quadtree Implementation to increase speed and memory
• Spatial Hashing
• Button to Reset Boids
    after change in sliders

• Add shading
    would have to make boids 3d and cast shadows off boids

• Add Requirements.txt file for other machines
• Add biases to boids
• Segment code in update_boids function into seperate functions

    But they all end up in the corner
